Steps to Follow from the Start
Create the build.js File:
powershell
New-Item -Path . -Name "build.js" -ItemType "file"
Open build.js in a Text Editor:
•	Using Visual Studio Code:
code build.js
Using Notepad:
notepad build.js

Copy and Paste the Script into build.js:
const { exec } = require('child_process');
const readline = require('readline');
const fs = require('fs');

const rl = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout
});

rl.question('Enter your build message: ', (message) => {
  exec('ng build --configuration=production', (err, stdout, stderr) => {
    const logMessage = `Build ${err ? 'failed' : 'completed successfully'} at ${new Date()}: ${message}\n`;
    fs.appendFileSync('build_log.txt', logMessage);

    if (err) {
      console.error(`Build failed: ${stderr}`);
    } else {
      console.log(`Build completed successfully: ${stdout}`);
    }

    rl.close();
  });
});
Save the build.js File:
•	Save the changes in your text editor.
Update package.json:
•	Open package.json in your text editor and add the new script:
Json:
"scripts": {
  "build:prod": "node build.js"
}
Run the Build Script:
•	Navigate to your project directory and run the following command to execute the script:
powershell
npm run build:prod
Running the Script
When you run the npm run build:prod command, you will be prompted to enter a build message. The script will then execute the Angular build command and log the build status along with the provided message to build_log.txt.
Enter Your Build Message
You'll be prompted to enter a build message. For example:
Plaintext:
Enter your build message: Fixed critical bug in user authentication
Build Process Output
After entering your message, the script will execute the Angular production build (ng build --configuration=production). Depending on whether the build succeeds or fails, you'll see corresponding output similar.

Build completed successfully: ...
Build failed: <error message>
Logging
Regardless of whether the build succeeds or fails, the script will append a log message to build_log.txt in the project directory. For example, if the build succeeded:
Build completed successfully at Wed Jun 23 2024 14:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time): Fixed critical bug in user authentication
If the build failed, it would similarly log the failure with the timestamp and the message.

# Got it! Here's a clean, well-commented summary of all the important Git commands you used for merging 
# the experiments branch into your profile-feature branch with conflict resolution 
# by overriding with experiments changes — all in one block for easy reference:

# Step 1: Switch to the target branch where you want to merge changes
git checkout profile-feature

# Step 2: Create a backup branch before merging, to save current state safely
git branch backup-profile-feature-before-merge

# Step 3: Attempt to merge 'experiments' branch into 'profile-feature'
git merge experiments
# You may encounter merge conflicts here:
#   Git will report conflicts like:
#     CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in <file>
#     CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in <file>

# Step 4: To resolve conflicts by overriding all changes with 'experiments' branch's version, 
# use the recursive strategy with 'theirs' option:
git merge -s recursive -X theirs experiments

# Explanation:
#   -s recursive: Use the default recursive merge strategy
#   -X theirs: Automatically choose 'theirs' changes on conflicts (i.e., from 'experiments' branch)

# Step 5: If Git opens an editor asking for a commit message (MERGE_MSG),
# simply save and close the editor to finalize the merge commit.
#   In vim, for example:
#     - Press `i` to enter insert mode and edit the message if needed
#     - Press `ESC` then type `:wq` and press Enter to save and quit

# Step 6: Verify the working tree is clean and merge completed successfully
git status

# Step 7: Confirm merge commit by checking the latest commits
git log --oneline -2

# Step 8 (Optional): Push the updated branch with merged changes to remote repository
git push origin profile-feature

# Summary of key points:
#   - Conflicts appeared because both branches modified same files.
#   - Using git merge -s recursive -X theirs tells Git to pick experiments changes automatically where conflicts appear.
#   - Commit message for the merge is required — save and exit editor.
#   - Backup branch created for safety before merge.
#   - git status and git log confirm the final state.
#   - Push changes to remote when ready.

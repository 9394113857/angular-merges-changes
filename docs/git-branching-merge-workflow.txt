# Step 1: Create and switch to a new branch for your feature-related work
# (File context: all your current changes related to the feature)
git checkout -b feature-branch

# Step 2: Stage all your changes for commit
git add .

# Step 3: Commit your changes with a clear message
git commit -m "Save feature-related changes temporarily"

# Step 4: Push this new branch to remote repository
git push origin feature-branch

# Explanation for Steps 1-4:
# 1. You create a new branch (feature-branch) to isolate your feature work.
# 2. You commit the changes to save your progress.
# 3. Pushing the branch to the remote ensures that your work is safely backed up and accessible to others.

# Step 5: Switch back to the main or working branch
git checkout main  # or use: git checkout working-branch

# Step 6: Discard any uncommitted changes to restore a clean state in the main/working branch
git reset --hard
git clean -fd

# Step 7: Pull the latest updates from remote main/working branch
git pull origin main  # or use: git pull origin working-branch

# Explanation for Steps 5-7:
# 4. You switch back to your main/working branch to continue development without interference from feature work.
# 5. You clean up uncommitted changes to ensure you're working with a clean slate.
# 6. Pulling the latest updates makes sure you're up-to-date with any changes others may have pushed.

# Step 8: When ready, merge your feature-branch back into the main/working branch
git merge feature-branch

# Step 9: Resolve any merge conflicts if they occur, then commit the merge if needed
# (Optional, depends on conflicts)
# git commit -m "Merge feature-branch into main/working-branch"

# Step 10: Push the merged branch back to remote repository
git push origin main  # or use: git push origin working-branch

# Explanation for Steps 8-10:
# 7. When your feature work is ready, you merge it back into the main/working branch.
# 8. If there are merge conflicts, resolve them manually before committing the merge.
# 9. Finally, you push the merged branch back to the remote repository to share your changes with the team.

# Summary:
# - This workflow ensures that feature work is isolated and can be merged back into the main/working branch when it's ready.
# - It helps avoid conflicts and keeps your main/working branch clean while enabling collaboration.

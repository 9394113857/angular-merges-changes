# Step 1: Save your current profile-related work on a new branch
git checkout -b profile-feature

# Step 2: Add and commit your profile changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add profile feature - initial commit"

# Step 3: Push the new profile branch to remote
git push origin profile-feature

# Step 4: Switch back to your original experiments branch
git checkout experiments

# Step 5: Pull the latest changes from remote experiments branch to restore old version
git pull origin experiments

# Step 6: Work on experiments branch as needed without losing your profile changes which are saved in profile-feature branch

# Step 7: When ready, merge profile-feature branch into experiments or main branch
git checkout experiments  # or main
git merge profile-feature

# Step 8: Resolve any merge conflicts if they arise

# Step 9: Push the merged branch back to remote
git push origin experiments  # or main

# Summary:
# - You create a new branch (profile-feature) to save your ongoing work.
# - Push that branch to remote to keep a backup.
# - Switch back to experiments branch and pull to restore old code.
# - Merge branches later after testing and verification.
